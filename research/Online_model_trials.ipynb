      " Why did Java become so famous in the past few years, you know with a lot of companies taking and use it as their language for writing applications on the back end that you’re kind of making a comparison here between server side development. everyone is talking about, they’ve been using PHP or Ruby but now they want to do this thing called Java. So why would I want to learn this language? Well let me tell you actually that there are four reasons especially today really why you may wanna consider learning more about Java. And we already covered one of them which is job market opportunities right at any given time if you go around asking like oh hey I need somebody who understands Java on my team what happens when people aren’t going well I don’t mind hiring someone I just I don’t know that doesn’t sound familiar to what else might happen right that person said well hold on wait how am I gonna vouch or even promote your skills out there amongst others being a programmer these days when you can use HTML and CSS and something and put together on some JavaScript kinda stuff and all that other goodness like what sounds more foreign to yourself than a word in an entire programming language then saying, hey yeah I do 2 years experience in Java like whatever could you repeat that again please, sorry get over here sir she had no idea this was actually ever existed because nobody else does either number two there’s very high salaries often involved for those who know Java and this by far is usually not hard to prove if you say Hey I know this skill set like it’s important that they’re willing to pay almost as much in many cases as the industry average for our information technology employees that says a lot on the industry average for IT professionals then obviously you want your product avaliable so number three learning new languages will help improve learning the most basic concept of things known by C# which that comes up with how some principles are the same and in addition to having good structure if you look at structured programming design through all this first 14 courses you already take away certain design patterns but also I mean we will always have different perspectives of solutions such as trying to avoid repetition from the point of view of source coding I hope after all this I think we can eliminate some pitfalls like loops repeating in doing it 10 million times and avoid to make program longer still having a working solution there should\n"
